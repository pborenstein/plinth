# Testing Guide: macos-launchd-service Skill

Step-by-step guide for testing the launchd service skill on existing nahuatl projects.

**Purpose**: Verify skill generates correct files and scripts work properly.

**Test projects**: temoa and apantli (both have existing launchd setups)

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] plinth repository at `/Users/philip/projects/plinth`
- [ ] temoa at `/Users/philip/projects/nahuatl-projects/temoa`
- [ ] apantli at `/Users/philip/projects/nahuatl-projects/apantli`
- [ ] Both projects have existing `launchd/` directories to compare against
- [ ] Claude Code session with plinth context loaded

---

## Test Plan Overview

1. Choose test project (temoa recommended - simpler setup)
2. Backup existing launchd setup
3. Invoke the macos-launchd-service skill
4. Provide parameters when asked
5. Compare generated files to existing files
6. Test generated scripts work
7. Verify service installs and runs
8. Test uninstaller
9. Restore backup or keep new files if better

---

## Phase 1: Setup and Backup

### 1.1 Choose Test Project

**Recommended**: Start with temoa (simpler - no Tailscale)

```bash
cd ~/projects/nahuatl-projects/temoa
```

### 1.2 Backup Existing launchd Directory

```bash
# Create backup
cp -r launchd launchd.backup
cp dev.sh dev.sh.backup
cp view-logs.sh view-logs.sh.backup

# Verify backup
ls -la launchd.backup/
ls -la *.backup
```

### 1.3 Document Existing Setup

Capture what's currently there for comparison:

```bash
# What files exist
ls -la launchd/

# Current service label
grep "<string>dev\." launchd/temoa.plist.template

# Current plist structure
cat launchd/temoa.plist.template

# Record current parameters
echo "Project: temoa"
echo "Port: 4001"
echo "Domain: dev.$(whoami)"  # Current uses dev.username
```

---

## Phase 2: Invoke the Skill

### 2.1 Start in Test Project Directory

```bash
cd ~/projects/nahuatl-projects/temoa
```

### 2.2 Invoke the Skill

In Claude Code, say:

```
Run the macos-launchd-service skill
```

### 2.3 Provide Parameters

The skill will ask for parameters. Have these ready:

**For temoa:**

- **Domain**: `dev.pborenstein` (or your owned domain)
- **Project name**: `temoa`
- **Module name**: `temoa`
- **Port**: `4001`
- **CLI command**: `temoa server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4001 --log-level info`
- **Dev command**: `temoa server --reload`
- **Process name**: `temoa server`

**For apantli (if testing second):**

- **Domain**: `dev.pborenstein`
- **Project name**: `apantli`
- **Module name**: `apantli`
- **Port**: `4000`
- **CLI command**: `python3 -m apantli.server --port 4000`
- **Dev command**: `python3 -m apantli.server --reload`
- **Process name**: `apantli.server`

### 2.4 Skill Will Generate Files

The skill will:

1. Read SKILL.md for instructions
2. Read pyproject.toml to help detect defaults
3. Ask you for parameters
4. Read templates from `~/projects/plinth/skills/macos-launchd-service/templates/`
5. Perform substitutions
6. Write files to:
   - `launchd/install.sh`
   - `launchd/uninstall.sh`
   - `launchd/temoa.plist.template`
   - `dev.sh`
   - `view-logs.sh`
7. Make scripts executable (chmod +x)

### 2.5 Verify Generation

After skill completes, check what was created:

```bash
# Should show new files (overwrote originals)
ls -la launchd/
ls -la dev.sh view-logs.sh

# Check for leftover template variables
grep "{{" launchd/* dev.sh view-logs.sh
# Should find nothing
```

---

## Phase 3: Compare Generated vs Backup

### 3.1 Compare Service Plist

```bash
# Side-by-side comparison
diff -u launchd.backup/temoa.plist.template launchd/temoa.plist.template

# Or use a visual diff tool
code --diff launchd.backup/temoa.plist.template launchd/temoa.plist.template
```

**Key differences to expect**:
- Label: `dev.philip.temoa` → `dev.pborenstein.temoa`
- Otherwise should be identical

### 3.2 Compare Install Script

```bash
diff -u launchd.backup/install.sh launchd/install.sh
```

**Key differences to expect**:
- SERVICE_PLIST path uses domain parameter instead of `dev.$USERNAME`
- Otherwise logic should be the same

### 3.3 Compare Dev Script

```bash
diff -u dev.sh.backup dev.sh
```

**Key differences to expect**:
- No USERNAME variable (removed)
- SERVICE_PLIST path uses domain directly
- Otherwise logic should be the same

### 3.4 Compare View Logs Script

```bash
diff -u view-logs.sh.backup view-logs.sh
```

**Should be identical** (no USERNAME references in original)

### 3.5 Check Uninstaller (New)

```bash
cat launchd/uninstall.sh
```

**Verify**:
- Uses correct domain and project name
- Has confirmation prompt
- Stops service before removing

**This is new** - backup won't have it, which is good!

---

## Phase 4: Test Generated Scripts

### 4.1 Test Install Script (Dry Run)

First, check the generated plist would be correct:

```bash
cd ~/projects/nahuatl-projects/temoa

# Check what would be generated (don't install yet)
cat launchd-test/install.sh | grep "SERVICE_PLIST="
# Should show: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.pborenstein.temoa.plist
```

### 4.2 Stop Existing Service

```bash
# Find current service
launchctl list | grep temoa

# Stop it
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.$(whoami).temoa.plist 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 4.3 Install Using Generated Script

```bash
cd ~/projects/nahuatl-projects/temoa
./launchd/install.sh
```

**Verify output**:
- [x] Environment detected correctly
- [x] venv validated
- [x] Module import check passed
- [x] Plist generated at correct path
- [x] Service loaded
- [x] Status shows running
- [x] Access URLs displayed

### 4.4 Verify Service Running

```bash
# Check service status
launchctl list | grep temoa
# Should show: dev.pborenstein.temoa

# Check service file exists
ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.pborenstein.temoa.plist

# Check service is responding
curl http://localhost:4001
# Should get response from temoa
```

### 4.5 Test View Logs Script

```bash
# In one terminal
./view-logs.sh

# In another terminal, make some requests
curl http://localhost:4001

# Verify logs appear in first terminal
# Ctrl+C to stop
```

### 4.6 Test Dev Script

```bash
./dev.sh
```

**Verify**:
- [x] Shows "Stopping launchd service..."
- [x] Service stops successfully
- [x] Asks about caffeinate
- [x] Runs temoa with --reload flag
- [x] Accessible at localhost:4001

**Test auto-reload**:
- Make a small change to a Python file
- Verify server reloads automatically

**Exit dev mode** (Ctrl+C):
- [x] Cleanup function runs
- [x] Asks "Restore launchd service? (y/n)"
- [x] Answer 'y' and verify service restores

### 4.7 Test Uninstaller

```bash
./launchd/uninstall.sh
```

**Verify**:
- [x] Shows what will be removed
- [x] Asks for confirmation
- [x] Answer 'y'
- [x] Stops running service
- [x] Removes plist file
- [x] Confirms completion
- [x] Shows reinstall command

**Verify service removed**:
```bash
# Should not find service
launchctl list | grep temoa

# Plist should be gone
ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.pborenstein.temoa.plist
# Should show "No such file or directory"
```

## Phase 5: Validation Checklist

### 5.1 Generated Files Quality

- [ ] All 5 files generated (install, uninstall, plist, dev, view-logs)
- [ ] Scripts are executable
- [ ] No leftover `{{VARIABLES}}` in generated files
- [ ] CLI_COMMAND properly formatted as plist array
- [ ] Domain parameter used correctly throughout

### 5.2 Scripts Work Correctly

- [ ] install.sh detects environment
- [ ] install.sh validates dependencies
- [ ] install.sh creates and loads service
- [ ] Service runs and responds on correct port
- [ ] view-logs.sh shows logs correctly
- [ ] dev.sh stops service and runs with reload
- [ ] dev.sh offers to restore on exit
- [ ] uninstall.sh asks confirmation
- [ ] uninstall.sh stops service
- [ ] uninstall.sh removes plist file

### 5.3 Comparison to Existing

- [ ] Generated files similar structure to existing
- [ ] Generated files have correct domain parameter
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Uninstaller is new addition (improvement)

---

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Decision

### 6.1 If Tests Pass

**Option A: Keep generated files (recommended)**

```bash
# Generated files already in place - just remove backups
rm -rf launchd.backup dev.sh.backup view-logs.sh.backup

# Service already running with new files
launchctl list | grep temoa
```

**Option B: Restore original**

```bash
# Stop service
./launchd/uninstall.sh

# Restore backup
rm -rf launchd dev.sh view-logs.sh
mv launchd.backup launchd
mv dev.sh.backup dev.sh
mv view-logs.sh.backup view-logs.sh

# Reinstall original service
./launchd/install.sh
```

### 6.2 If Tests Fail

Document what failed:

```bash
# In plinth repo
cd ~/projects/plinth

# Create issue document
cat > TESTING-RESULTS.md << EOF
# Testing Results - $(date)

## Test Project: temoa

### Issues Found:

1. [Describe issue]
   - Expected: [what should happen]
   - Actual: [what happened]
   - File: [which template/script]

2. [Next issue]

### Files with Problems:

- [ ] install.sh.template
- [ ] uninstall.sh.template
- [ ] service.plist.template
- [ ] dev.sh.template
- [ ] view-logs.sh.template

### Next Steps:

[What needs to be fixed]
EOF
```

---

## Phase 7: Test on Second Project (Optional)

If temoa tests pass, repeat on apantli:

```bash
cd ~/projects/nahuatl-projects/apantli
```

**Note**: apantli has Tailscale support - skill doesn't generate that yet.

**Modifications needed for apantli**:
- Port: 4000
- CLI_COMMAND: different (uses `python3 -m apantli.server`)
- May need to handle Tailscale plist separately

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 testing complete when:

- [x] Templates generate valid files
- [x] All scripts execute without errors
- [x] Service installs and runs correctly
- [x] Service accessible on specified port
- [x] Dev mode works (stop service, run with reload, restore)
- [x] Uninstaller works (confirmation, stop, remove)
- [x] Generated files comparable quality to existing
- [x] No regressions compared to manual setup

---

## Troubleshooting

**Service won't start**:
```bash
# Check error logs
tail ~/Library/Logs/temoa.error.log

# Validate plist syntax
plutil -lint ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.pborenstein.temoa.plist
```

**Port already in use**:
```bash
# Find what's using port
lsof -i :4001

# Kill process
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Permission errors**:
```bash
# Ensure LaunchAgents exists
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents

# Check file permissions
ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.pborenstein.temoa.plist
```

**Template substitution errors**:
```bash
# Check for leftover variables
grep "{{" launchd/* dev.sh view-logs.sh
```

---

## Notes

- Skill invocation happens in Claude Code conversation
- No manual bash scripting needed - that was wrong approach
- Skill reads templates and generates files directly
- Can repeat on multiple projects to validate
- Document any issues found in plinth repo

---

## Quick Test Flow

1. `cd ~/projects/nahuatl-projects/temoa`
2. Backup: `cp -r launchd launchd.backup && cp dev.sh dev.sh.backup && cp view-logs.sh view-logs.sh.backup`
3. In Claude: "Run the macos-launchd-service skill"
4. Provide parameters when asked
5. Test generated scripts
6. Keep or restore
