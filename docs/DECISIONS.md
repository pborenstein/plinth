# Plinth Architectural Decisions

Registry of key decisions made during plinth development.

**Purpose**: Quick lookup of why we chose specific approaches.

---

## Decision Governance

**When to add a decision**:
- Chose between multiple valid approaches
- Made architectural choice affecting future development
- Decided NOT to do something for specific reasons

**Process**:
1. Document decision in chronicle entry (detailed rationale)
2. Add row to table below (one-line summary)
3. Commit both files together

**Decision numbering**: Sequential (DEC-001, DEC-002, etc.)

## Decision Registry

| DEC-002 | 3 | Prioritize launchd service setup over other patterns (high value, complex) |
