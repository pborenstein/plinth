- Implemented complete token-efficient system (75% pickup reduction)
- Created CONTEXT.md template and plinth's own CONTEXT.md
- Migrated plinth docs: compressed IMPLEMENTATION.md, converted DECISIONS.md, deleted CHRONICLES.md
- All templates created (slim chronicle, heading-based decisions)
- Commands updated (session-pickup, session-wrapup, new migrate command)
- 670-line DOCUMENTATION-GUIDE.md rewritten
- README.md updated with token efficiency metrics

## Next Session

Test the system in practice. Consider testing migration command on a legacy project.
