# Session Pick-up

Read context from previous session to prepare for new work.

## Tasks to complete:

1. Find the current phase in docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md:
   - Use Grep to search for "🔵" to find the current phase line number
   - Use Read with offset/limit to read ~200-300 lines starting from that marker
   - Understand from that section:
     - What phase/sub-phase is active
     - Task checkboxes and their status
     - Any notes about what to work on next
   - DO NOT read the entire IMPLEMENTATION.md file

2. Make a plan for what to do next based on the current phase section

Note: CHRONICLES.md and DECISIONS.md are historical context. The current phase
section contains all active work context needed to resume.
