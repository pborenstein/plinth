# Session Pick-up

Read context from previous session to prepare for new work.

## Tasks to complete:

1. Read docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md - Find the section marked with 🔵 (current phase)
   Read ONLY that section to understand:
   - What phase/sub-phase is active
   - Task checkboxes and their status
   - Any notes about what to work on next
   - Typically ~200 lines of active context

2. Make a plan for what to do next based on the current phase section

Note: CHRONICLES.md and DECISIONS.md are historical context. The current phase
section contains all active work context needed to resume.
